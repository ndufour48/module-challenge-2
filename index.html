            Hi, my name is Nicholas, but you can call me Nick for short. Some adjectives I would use to describe myself are hard working, alpha male, jackhammer, merciless, and insatiable. For those who may not have understood the light hearted joke, that was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJzMUqXrQrE" target="_blank">Dwight Schrute refference</a> from the award winning television series The Office. As you may be able to tell, I enjoy watching television, playing video games, attending music events, and hiking. I'm currently attending a Georgia Tech Bootcamp to become a full stack developer. My current day-to-day consists of waking up early, going to the gym, then coming home to code for a few hours. The rest of my day depends on my schedule, I either attend class, or spend time with friends and family. I try to round my night off by learning something new, or coding some more. I love coding and all things tech, but have a ton of knowlege in logistics, and leading teams. Between my 8+ years of experience in logistics, and my drive for creating within the tech world, I'm confident that I would be a valuable member of a team that shares the same goals and passions.
